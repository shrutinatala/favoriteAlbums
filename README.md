# SEA Stage 2 - Data Catalog Project

Here is my submission for stage two of the Snap Engineering Academy application process.

## My Project

One of my favorite things to do is share music with others. That inspired me to create a website to display and share my favorite albums for this Data Catalog Project.

I wanted to theme my website around the experience of browsing through a stack of CDs. Since we don't really use CDs that often anymore, I wanted the site to feel somewhat nostalgic. I did my best to create that feeling through my CSS.

## Website Features

- Hovering on each album will allow you to see the name of the album, year released, artist, and my favorite track.
- Clicking on each album will take you to a YouTube link with my favorite track.
- Users can use the search bar to search up album titles, years, artists, and my favorite tracks.
- Users can sort through the albums by album title, artist, newest/oldest, and by the decade made.
- Clicking on each of the buttons once will toggle to the opposite order when clicked again. For example, after clicked "Newest to Oldest", the button will change to "Oldest to Newest". When the user clicks "Oldest to Newest", the order will reverse.
- New albums can be added by logging in. The password to login is "snap".
- Clicking on the reset button or the title of the website will return the list of albums to their original configuration and remove all albums added through the form on the website.

I hope you enjoy my website and find some new music!
